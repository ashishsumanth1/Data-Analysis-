## Introduction
Census data has always been crucial in creating a country's infrastructure and policies. It gives a thorough picture of a nation's population, encompassing demographic, economic, and social information. Governments, academics, and businesses depend on the data to help them make well-informed choices that reflect public preferences and fashions. Census 2021 was distinct. To give more accuracy and coverage, it made use of cutting-edge technology, including digital data collection techniques and sophisticated data processing. This digital transformation ensured more accurate and accessible results.

#### Data Accessibility and Democratization
A noteworthy feature of Census 2021 is its dedication to openness and data democratization. The Census Authority developed an official website, offering a user-friendly platform for people to explore and download datasets directly, realizing the value of making data available to the public. This shift toward open data has been revolutionary.

This wealth of data is now available to academics, decision-makers, corporations, and even curious individuals. The data is provided in an approachable manner that makes it simple to download and integrate into various analytical tools for specialized insights. The government has enforced transparency and promoted a culture of investigation, analysis, and data-driven decision-making by making Census 2021 data easily accessible.

### Project Aims and Objectives

#### Aim
Our primary aim in undertaking this project is to delve deep into the qualifications and occupations datasets from Census 2021 provided by the ONS. By analyzing the inherent correlations and trends between these two sets, we endeavor to:

- Understand the relationship between qualifications and occupations across various electoral wards.
- Identify outliers and their significance in the broader spectrum of the data.
- Explore the implications of qualification preferences like classroom-based education versus apprenticeship programs.
- Examine the predominant occupations inwards based on different types of qualifications.
- Assess the influence of higher education and specific occupations on employment rates in electoral wards.
- Identify potential mismatches or gaps between acquired qualifications and the jobs people eventually engage in.
- Create a machine learning model designed to predict an individual's chances of securing a job based on their qualifications and the patterns observed in the electoral ward data.

### Methodology


#### Machine Learning Model Development
**Feature Engineering**: Relevant features were extracted and sometimes transformed to ensure the machine learning model would perform optimally.

**Model Selection**: Based on the nature of our data and the problem statement, an appropriate machine-learning algorithm was chosen.

**Training and Validation**: The data was split into training and validation sets. The model was trained on the former and its performance evaluated on the latter.

**Model Optimization**: Based on the performance metrics, the model parameters were tuned to optimize its predictive accuracy.

#### Application Development
**Flask App Creation**: An interactive Flask web application was developed. This user-friendly platform serves as an interface for individuals to interact with the data and access the machine learning model for predictions.

**Deployment**: Once developed, the application was deployed, making it accessible to users.


## Data
#### Data Acquisition
**Source Identification**: The foremost step involved pinpointing a reliable data source. The datasets have to be broad and relevant to the study. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) website, specifically the URL "[https://www.ons.gov.uk/](https://www.ons.gov.uk/)", was identified as a prime source due to its comprehensive nature and extensive coverage of the Census 2021 data.

#### Data Pre-processing
**Preparing and refining the data** is paramount to ensure accuracy in subsequent analysis stages.

- **Data Cleaning**: The qualification and occupation databases were both essentially in pristine condition, suggesting they had already been cleaned. To ensure our research's accuracy, a careful review was conducted to look for any inconsistencies. Unnecessary columns were removed, making the dataset more suitable for our analytical goals.

## Methodology

This methodology section presents our structured approach to ensure robust and meaningful insights into achieving the project's aims and objectives.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Data Visualization**: Graphs, plots, and charts were employed to get a preliminary understanding of the data distributions, trends, and patterns.

**Statistical Analysis**: Key statistical measures were computed to understand the central tendencies, variations, and other characteristics of the data.

#### Advanced Data Analysis
**Correlation Analysis**: We extensively looked at the linear relationships between educational qualifications and occupational categories. This thorough analysis aimed to clarify the degree to which different educational backgrounds may impact or direct people towards particular professional fields.

**Cluster Analysis**: K-means clustering was employed, segmenting the data into clusters based on inherent similarities. This provided insights into how qualifications and job types naturally group together, revealing any mismatches.

### Methodology for Calculating Employment Rate
This is a key measure that gives us an idea of how many people in a particular area are working compared to those who are not. This data was obtained to use for our machine learning model preparation. The employment rate is the ratio of the number of employed individuals to the total workforce (i.e., the sum of employed and not employed individuals). The formula we employed to determine this is:

\[ \text{Employment Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Employed}}{\text{Number of Employed} + \text{Number of Not Employed}} \]

This method is widely used, including by respected organizations like the Office for National Statistics in 2019. This approach helps provide a clear picture of the employment situation in any given area.

### Employment-Based Ward Categorization
The methodology adopted in this study for classifying each ward into distinct categories — 'High', 'Medium', and 'Low' — is based on the employment rate of each ward. This categorization is given to the machine learning algorithm as the target feature.

#### 1. Determining the Thresholds for Categorization:
Instead of arbitrarily choosing cut-offs, we turned to statistical measures that would offer an objective way to segment the wards. Specifically, we calculated two crucial percentiles of the employment rate:
- The 33rd percentile is also known as the lower third. This value serves as the boundary between the 'Low' and 'Medium' categories.
- The 66th percentile, which is the upper third. This acts as the boundary separating the 'Medium' and 'High' categories.

#### 2. Categorizing the Wards:
With these thresholds established, we proceeded to categorize each ward based on its employment rate:
- Wards with employment rates exceeding the 66th percentile (upper threshold) were classified as 'High probability'. This suggests that a significant majority of their residents are employed.
- Wards with employment rates falling between the 33rd percentile (lower threshold) and the 66th percentile were designated as 'Medium probability'. This indicates a moderate level of employment among its residents.
- Wards that had employment rates below the 33rd percentile were labeled as 'Low probability'. These are areas that might require closer attention due to their lower employment figures.
